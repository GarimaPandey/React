React Element is an object rendered to the dom element.

when it renders into the dom it converts itself into html and render to the dom


npm
-manages packages

it manages lots of packages from node but it does not stands
 for node package manager


include node packages:

npm init
-
define details for package.json


package.json
- configuration for our npm
^-minor updates
~- major updatesv


bundler
- bundlers like vite,parcel uses webpacks which helps to bundle 
the application and minify its big files before we push to prodyction


parcel
- dev build
- run server
- HMR Hot Module Replacement
- uses a File Watching algorithm written in C++
- parcel has its own cache, parcel-cache
- image optimization
- minify files for production
- compress and pack all js files and ship it for production and deployement
- tree shaking (removes unused code)
- different dev and production bundlers
- using browserslist :["Last two Chrome versions"], i can decide 






parcel command
npm install -D parcel
D here means dev dependency and not normal dependency as we are using for local development and not production



Always push package.json and package-lock.json to github to keep a record of your dependency for production

this can help you recreate the dependencies for you

you don't need to push node modules as it will recreate it in production using package.json

-
.gitignore contains all the files which does not need to push it to git


ignite your app:
-npx parcel index.html
to execute a package use "npx"


command to build production
npx parcel build index.html
(remove main:"App.js" from package.json so parcel does not have confusion with application's entry point)


npx parcel index.html
npx - npm package is being executed
using parcel package
where index.html is the source file

npm i , i is a shortform to npm install





- jsx looks like html syntax
-  so what ever code we ewrite in html and render it to reactDom ,it is transpiled by parcel using babel
- BABEL IS  A POWERFUL TOOL USED BY PARCEL, which converts jsx to react.createElement, its a js compiler
